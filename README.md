   My final project for CS306. Implement several Maximum 0-1 knapsack algorithms and SAT algorithms, which include
   a.
   b.
   c.
   d.
   e.
   f.
   Compared each type of algorithm against 100 random instances to comare it's runtime and optimal solution.
   A write up of the results are in this repository.
