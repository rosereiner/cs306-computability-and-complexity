This is a repository to hold all work from Skidmore College's CS306 Computability and Complexity Course.

1. 306algorithms
   # My final project for CS306. Implement several Maximum 0-1 knapsack algorithms and SAT algorithms, which include
      * a. CS305 Dynamic Programming Maximum 0-1 Knapsack Algorithm    
      *b. Greedy 2-Approximation Algorithm
      *c. MinCost Algorithm
      * d. FPTAS Algorithm
      * e. GSAT Algorithm
      * f. DPLL Algorithm
      * g. Maximum 3-SAT Algortm
   Compared each type of algorithm against 100 random instances to comare 
   it's runtime and optimal solution.
   A write up of the results are in this repository.
   
2. 306algorithms_Report.pdf
   A report on the 306algorithms final project. Implemented 7 algorithms and 
   ran them against 100 random instances. Results are written up in this    
   report.
